1. Verify that your development environment meets application requirements.
2. Verify that your frontend and backend `.env` match the samples provided, and contain valid details specific to your development environment.
3. Create a database in MySQL with a name matching the `MYSQLDATABASE` in the `.env` file.
4. Ensure MySQL is running and accessible on `MYSQLHOST` and `MYSQLPORT` as specified in `.env`.
5. Execute `npm install` in the terminal of your frontend and backend to install required dependencies.
6. If running tests, ensure that `NODE_ENV=test` in your backend environment. Otherwise, remove this for development.
7. Run migration scripts by executing `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all --config src/config/config-wrapper.cjs` in your backend terminal.
